# Model Converter (Pure Python)

Convert `.fbx`, `.unitypackage`, `.vrm`, `.pmx`, and `.uemodel` (UEFormat) into each other — and `.psk` / `.pskx` (Unreal ActorX) into PMX — **entirely with the Python standard library**.
No Blender / Autodesk FBX SDK / Unity 3D required, and no plugins such as mmd_tools / UniVRM.
It reads and writes the binary formats directly — just drag a file into the window to convert.

## 1. Features

### Supported conversion directions

| Direction | Description |
|---|---|
| FBX / unitypackage → PMX | PMX 2.0 for MMD; quads are auto-fan-triangulated |
| VRM (0.x / 1.0) → PMX | Auto-detects humanoid bones; fills missing ones with placeholder bones |
| PMX → VRM (0.x / 1.0) | Auto-writes VRM meta, humanoid bone mapping, and morph targets |
| uemodel (UEFormat) → PMX | Reads the public UEFormat `.uemodel` (v1–v10); can also write an ASCII FBX in the same run |
| PMX → uemodel (UEFormat) | Writes UEFormat `.uemodel` (v9 by default, v10 optional) for the UE / FModel toolchain |
| PSK / PSKX (Unreal ActorX) → PMX | Reads Unreal `.psk` (`FACE0000`) / `.pskx` (`FACE3200`) with skin weights, MRPH vertex morphs and extra UVs |
| PMX → validation + preview only | Read-only structural validation; no file output |

### Core features

- **Zero external dependencies**: Pure Python standard library (tkinter + ctypes). `Pillow` is an optional accelerator —
  its absence only affects texture-decode speed and some previews, not the main pipeline.
- **Drag & drop, ready to use**: Uses the native Windows `WM_DROPFILES`; you can drop anywhere in the window, with no
  third-party library like tkinterdnd2.
- **Selected-file list**: after dropping, the files (name / format / size) and the total size are listed right under the drop
  area. You can append more, remove single rows, or double-click one row to preview just that file — so **you can see at a
  glance what this batch will convert**, and nothing runs until you click "Start conversion".
- **Real-time front-view preview**: Drag in a model and see the 3D front view immediately; drag to rotate / scroll to zoom,
  and overlay bone points to check alignment (the Front / Left / Back / Top buttons are named after **which side of the model you see**).
- **Never applies Toon**: Every PMX written by every direction uses `toon_flag=0` + `toon=-1`,
  i.e. "no toon" in MMD terms.
- **Multilingual UI**: Switch between Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / Japanese in the top-right; the choice is saved to config.
- **HiDPI friendly**: Auto-scales to system DPI; the top-right "UI zoom" lets you set a manual factor.
- **Tabbed options**: The options area is split into five tabs — General / FBX / VRM / UE / Output — for easy extension.
- **Automatic winding-order detection**: Triangle winding is auto-decided by voting between geometric-face normals and vertex normals,
  avoiding large holes / outline lines smearing into black blobs.
- **Texture handling**: PNG/JPEG pass through directly; BMP/TGA are converted to PNG on the fly; embedded in GLB or exported to the PMX directory.
- **PSK / PSKX support**: Reads both `.psk` (`FACE0000`) and `.pskx` (`FACE3200`), carrying over skin weights,
  MRPH vertex morphs and `EXTRAUVS*` extra UV sets. The Bip001 (3ds Max Biped) bone naming is mapped to
  MMD standard Japanese bone names (`センター` / `上半身` / `左足ＩＫ` …) with the **original English name kept in the
  bone's English-name field**, so nothing is lost.

---

## 2. Requirements

- **Windows** (drag & drop and the GUI depend on native Windows APIs)
- **Python 3.10+** (3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14 recommended; must ship with tkinter)
- **Optional**: `Pillow` (accelerates texture decoding and preview)

> Engine modules are grouped by responsibility into the `formats/` `convert/` `gfx/` sub-directories. At runtime
> `main.py` inserts these three directories into `sys.path`, so modules still use bare-name `import`s (e.g. `import fbx2pmx`).

## 4. Usage

### Method 1: Graphical interface (recommended)

1. Run `python main.py`
2. **Drag** a `.fbx` / `.unitypackage` / `.vrm` / `.pmx` / `.uemodel` file **anywhere into the window**, or click the drop area to choose a file.
   **Dropping only loads the file and shows the preview — nothing is converted automatically.**
   Check the task direction and options, then click "Start conversion" to run.
3. A **selected-file list** (file name / format / size) appears under the drop area, so you can see at a glance what will be converted:
   - dropping again **appends** to the list; duplicates are skipped by absolute path;
   - double-click a row to preview just that file;
   - select rows and click "Remove selected" (or press Delete), or "Clear list" to start over;
   - while the list has files, the drop area shrinks into a thin strip so the list gets the vertical space.
4. The "Task" dropdown can manually specify the conversion direction; by default it is auto-detected from the file extension. Switching the task re-filters the already-loaded files (the list updates too).
5. Conversion log sits at the bottom-left; the model preview is the full-height right column.

UI highlights:

- **Split view**: drag the divider in the middle to resize, just like Blender's areas; the position is saved in `config.json`
- **Full-height preview column**: live front view, with Front / Left / Back / Top / Reset / Spin / Bones / Wire in the toolbar below it.
  The four view buttons are named after **which side of the model you see**: Front = you see the face (camera at `-Z`, which is
  MMD's front), Back = you see the back (camera at `+Z`), Left = you see the model's left side (camera at `+X`; in MMD `+X` is
  the model's left hand side), Top = looking down from above
- **Render backend badge (bottom-right of the preview)**: shows whether `Pillow` or pure Python is in use, plus the last frame time in ms
- **"Language" (top-right)**: Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / Japanese (the preview toolbar follows too)
- **"UI zoom" (top-right)**: Auto-follows system DPI, or set a manual factor
- **Option tabs**: General / FBX / VRM / UE / Output, five tabs
- **UE tab**: when the `.uemodel` → PMX task is selected, tick "also export an FBX file" to get an ASCII FBX next to the PMX; the same tab sets target height (cm) and alpha handling
- **FBX tab**: three settings; changing them updates both the preview and the "Start conversion" result immediately
  - **Texture alpha channel**: `Keep` (as-is) / `Auto (recommended)` / `Strip all`.
    MMD treats texture alpha directly as material opacity, while game textures often abuse alpha as an emissive or specular mask.
    Those masks must be stripped, otherwise the model turns half-transparent or shows ghost artifacts; real transparency must be kept, otherwise lace, veils and hair tips get clipped into hard edges.
    `Auto` samples only the UV area the texture actually uses (up to 4000 points) and asks whether "almost-fully-transparent ≥ 75% **and** opaque ≤ 5%", cross-checked against whole-image statistics.
    Only when both agree is it treated as a mask — then a copy named `<name>_noalpha.png` is written and **the material is repointed at the copy; the original texture file is never modified**.
  - **Auto-detect facing**: FBX has no "which way does the model face" field. The handedness conversion needs a single-axis reflection, and which axis you reflect decides whether the model ends up facing or facing away from the camera.
    With this on it tries **toe direction** (sum of toe bone offsets relative to their parents, only counted when `|x| << |z|`), then falls back to **face mesh centroid** (weighted centre of face / head / eye / mouth / brow meshes versus the whole-body centre). The verdict and the evidence both go into the log.
  - (Always on) **Meshes with no material attached are skipped**. Game exports (Unity / HoYo style) often carry a sheet named `EffectMesh`: no material node, no texture, UVs spread over the whole atlas, geometry a thin plate spanning the body. Exported as a normal mesh it becomes an opaque grey slab lying on top of the dress — which looks exactly like "the texture got flipped", when in fact the UVs are fine and only the base color is covered up. The log prints `skip <mesh> tris=<n> (no material / effect sheet)`.
  - **Force extra 180° turn**: adds another 180° around Y on top of the detected result. Use it only when auto-detection finds nothing (both heuristics unavailable) or when you genuinely want the model facing away.
- **Textures in the exported FBX**: the written FBX **flips the UV V axis** (PMX/MMD put the UV origin top-left, FBX / Blender / Maya bottom-left) and references textures as a relative path `textures/…`. Keep the FBX next to the PMX together with its `textures` folder — otherwise the shape looks right but the patterns are shifted all over
- **Enlarged checkboxes**: The checkboxes and click areas are easier to hit

### Why the preview stays smooth on heavy models

The live preview is a pure-Python software rasterizer (no OpenGL), so it works in three layers:

1. **Decimated mesh while dragging** — interactively renders ~12k triangles, so a
   90k-triangle model costs about 40 ms per frame;
2. **Sliced refinement after you stop** — the refined frame advances 1500 triangles
   per slice, capped at 24 ms per time slice, so the picture sharpens piece by piece
   without freezing the UI;
3. **Adaptive pixel budget** — resolution scales with the measured frame time, and
   Pillow (when installed) upscales the low-res result to canvas size in C.

### Method 2: Command line

> Always wrap paths containing spaces or non-ASCII characters in double quotes; engine scripts live in the `convert/` `formats/` sub-directories.

#### Common options quick reference

`fbx2pmx.py`:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--scale mmd` | Default; auto-scale to MMD standard height (≈ 20 units) |
| `--scale raw` | Keep FBX's original size (meters) |
| `--scale 12.5` | Manually specify a scale factor |
| `--no-flip-z` | Skip right-handed → left-handed conversion (on by default) |
| `--alpha keep\|auto\|strip` | Texture alpha handling, default `auto` (see below) |
| `--remove-alpha` | Legacy switch, equivalent to `--alpha auto` |
| `--no-auto-facing` | Disable facing auto-detection, use the default single-axis reflection (Z) |
| `--face-180` | Force an extra 180° turn on top of the detected result |
| `--keep-untextured-meshes` | Keep meshes that carry no material (skipped by default, see "effect sheet" below) |
| `--info` | Only print structure info, no conversion |

What the three `--alpha` modes do:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `keep` | Leave alpha alone; reference the original texture files directly |
| `auto` (default) | Judge per texture: only ones classified as a mask get an alpha-free copy `<name>_noalpha.png` and a repointed material; genuinely translucent or fully opaque ones are kept as-is |
| `strip` | Strip alpha from anything that has an alpha channel (the old behaviour) |

Detection thresholds (identical to the `PEPlugins-FBXimport` plug-in): alpha < 8 counts as transparent, > 250 as opaque;
the UV-area sampling (up to 4000 points) and whole-image statistics must corroborate each other, and **transparent ≥ 75% with opaque ≤ 5%** is required to call it a mask.
With no usable UV it falls back to 90% / 1% over the whole image. Per-texture verdicts (name → strip / keep plus the transparent and opaque ratios) are written to the log.

`pmx2vrm.py`: `--spec 1.0|0x`, `--scale auto|factor`, `--rotate auto|none|y180`,
`--flip-winding`, `--force-double-sided`, `--max-morphs N`, `--title` / `--author`.

`vrm2pmx.py`: `--scale`, `--rotate`, `--flip-winding`, `--edge` (enable outline),
`--force-double-sided`, `--name`.

`psk2pmx.py`:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--scale mmd` | Default; normalizes height to MMD's standard 20 units via the bounding box |
| `--scale 0.14` | Manual scale factor |
| `--edge` | Enable MMD outline on materials (off by default) |
| `--force-double-sided` | Force two-sided drawing (common for thin hair / skirts) |
| `--no-textures` | Don't look for textures; export an untextured model |
| `--keep-alpha` | Keep texture alpha (by default alpha is stripped per material) |
| `--no-add-uv` | Drop `EXTRAUVS*` extra UV sets |
| `--raw-bone-names` | Keep the original English bone names (default: convert to MMD Japanese names, originals kept in the English-name field) |
| `--no-ik` | Don't add MMD leg IK bones (default: add `左足ＩＫ` / `左つま先ＩＫ` when the leg chain is complete) |
| `--no-morphs` | Don't export morphs (default: convert MRPH vertex offsets into PMX vertex morphs) |
| `--fbx` | Also write an ASCII FBX next to the PMX |
| `--name` | Model name |

For more detailed options and format mappings, see `FBX转PMX_使用说明.md` and `VRM互转_使用说明.md`.

## 5. Build & packaging

### 1. Install PyInstaller

```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
pip install pillow          # optional; makes the bundled build also get the texture-speedup
```

### 2. Build with the spec (recommended)

> **Always use the spec**; do not run `pyinstaller main.py` directly.

```powershell
pyinstaller main.spec
```

Output: `dist/ModelConvert.exe/ModelConvert.exe` (one-folder mode).

### 3. Why the spec is mandatory

Engine modules are placed in the `formats/` `convert/` `gfx/` sub-directories, and `main.py` uses bare-name
imports like `import fbx2pmx`. The sub-directories are only added at **runtime** via `sys.path.insert`.
**PyInstaller only does static analysis and cannot see the runtime path injection** — if those sub-directories
are absent from `pathex`, the build stage silently drops them as "missing modules". The build succeeds, but at
runtime it throws:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fbx2pmx'
```

`main.spec` already configures this correctly:

```python
Analysis(
    ['main.py'],
    pathex=['.', 'formats', 'convert', 'gfx'],     # let static analysis find the sub-dir modules
    hiddenimports=['fbx2pmx', 'pmx_check', 'pmx2vrm', 'vrm2pmx', 'preview',
                   'unitypackage_unpack', 'fbx_reader', 'pmxio', 'vrmio'],
    ...
)
```

If you don't want to use the spec, the equivalent command is:

```powershell
pyinstaller --paths formats --paths convert --paths gfx -w main.py
```

### 4. Common options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-F` | Build into a single executable |
| `-D` | Build into a folder containing multiple files (default) |
| `-w` | Hide the console window (GUI app) |
| `-i icon.ico` | Specify the executable icon |
| `-n name` | Specify the generated executable name |
| `--add-data "src:dst"` | Add resource files |
| `--hidden-import module` | Manually add a hidden dependency |

---

## 6. Notes

### General

1. **Paths with spaces / non-ASCII**: Always wrap them in double quotes on the command line.
2. **Settings file `config.json`**: Stores language, UI zoom, task direction, and each option; it is recreated with defaults if deleted.
1. **Shortcuts & interaction**: The preview area supports drag-to-rotate and scroll-to-zoom; clicking the drop area opens a file picker.

### Model all-black / black outline / holes

- **Black lines on model edges after conversion**: The converter now disables the MMD outline by default (vertex edge=0, material edge_size=0, edge_color alpha=0). If you still see black edges, open the model in MMD / PMXEditor, make sure the **outline is turned off** for all materials, and check **"Double-sided drawing"**.
- **Still has holes**: First look at the `绕序自动判定` (auto winding-order detection) line in the log. If it's wrong, add `--flip-winding`; if thin geometry (hair / skirt) relies on double-sided rendering, add `--force-double-sided`, or check "Force double-sided materials" in the UI.

### Model facing away / wrong direction

- FBX stores no "which way is forward" field, so no heuristic is right 100% of the time. Keep **"Auto-detect facing"** on (default) in the FBX tab and the converter tries **toe direction** first, then **face mesh centroid**, writing both the verdict and the evidence to the log (`自动判定朝向：面朝 +Z（依据：脚尖）`).
- When neither heuristic yields anything (non-standard bone names and no recognizable face mesh) it falls back to the default reflection. If the model then **faces away from the camera** in MMD, tick **"Force extra 180° turn"** (`--face-180`): it just negates X and Z together (half a turn around Y), leaving vertex / face / bone counts and the winding-order detection untouched.
- If the verdict itself is wrong, disable it with `--no-auto-facing` and dial it in manually with `--face-180` — the equivalent of `AutoDetectFacing=false` + `Rot180Y=true` in the plug-in.
- **PSK / PSKX is not affected by any of this**: the Unreal PSK format has a well-defined axis convention
  (`-Y` is the front), so the axis swap is a fixed single reflection and needs no detection. If a PSK you have
  comes out facing away, its source convention differs from the norm — rotate it 180° around Y in PMXEditor.

### Transparent where it shouldn't be / opaque where it should be

- **Whole model half-transparent, ghost artifacts**: the texture almost certainly uses alpha as an emissive / specular mask. Use `--alpha strip` ("Strip all" in the UI); day to day leave it on `auto`, which judges each texture and only processes the ones classified as masks.
- **Lace / veils / hair tips clipped into hard edges**: real transparency got stripped — switch back to `auto` or pick `keep`.
- In every mode **the source texture file itself is never modified**: the stripped result goes to a `<name>_noalpha.png` copy and only the material reference is repointed.
- The `贴图透明通道` block in the log lists every texture as "name → strip / keep (transparent x%, opaque y%)" — read that when you're unsure.

### A grey slab covers the model / looks like "the UVs got flipped"

- Don't reach for the UVs yet. Game FBX files (Unity / HoYo style) often contain an `EffectMesh` with **no material node and no texture**, UVs spread across the whole atlas, geometry a thin plate spanning the body. Exported as an ordinary mesh it becomes an opaque grey slab sitting right on top of the skirt — visually almost identical to "the texture is flipped vertically", but the UVs are actually correct.
- The converter **skips every mesh that has no material** by default, and logs `skip <mesh> tris=<n> (no material / effect sheet)`. Check the log for that line to confirm.
- If you do need such a mesh, pass `--keep-untextured-meshes` (there is no UI toggle for it; command line only).

### Known limitations

- **FBX structure**: both binary FBX 7.x and ASCII FBX are read (the older "ASCII is not supported" note was wrong).
- **Texture formats**: DDS / KTX2 / WebP are skipped (material degrades to a solid color).
- **Physics**: PMX rigidbody/joint ↔ VRM SpringBone are **not** converted between each other.
- **Material effects**: Spherical maps (.sph/.spa) and toon maps are not preserved on the VRM side; in the other direction (→ PMX) this tool never applies toon.
- **Bone names**: FBX conversion keeps English bone names (`Hips`, `Spine` …), so they won't match MMD's ready-made motions (.vmd); you must batch-rename them to the Japanese standard names in PMXEditor.
  PSK takes a different route: the Bip001 (3ds Max Biped) naming is **converted to MMD standard Japanese names by default**, with the original English name kept in the bone's English-name field.
- **Morphs**: When the source model has no BlendShape / morph, the PMX morphs are also 0 and must be created by hand.
- **PSK is one-way only**: `.psk` / `.pskx` can only be converted to PMX; there is no reverse export.
- **PSK axes are a fixed mapping**: Unreal's PSK is "`+X` left hand, `-Y` front, `+Z` up" while PMX is
  "`+X` left hand, `-Z` front, `+Y` up" — opposite handedness, so the axis swap must include **one reflection**
  (`(x, y, z) → (x, z, y)`). This is hard-coded; there is no "auto-detect facing" switch like FBX has.
- **The `.psk` extension collides**: PmxEditor stores its "anchor data" in `.psk` files, the same extension Unreal meshes use.
  See "PmxEditor reports アンカーデータの読み込みに失敗しました" below.

### MMD says it cannot load the model (text encoding)

MMD **only accepts PMX files whose text encoding is UTF-16LE**. The original message is
`MMDではエンコード方式がUTF16のPMXファイルしか読み込めません`
(English string in the same binary: `MMD can't read UTF8 encorded PMX. Please exchange it to UTF16.`).
The Chinese localizations render it as "MMD 不能载入编码为 UTF16 的 PMX 文件", which is a
**mistranslation that reverses the meaning** — seeing it means the file was saved as UTF-8.

This tool always writes UTF-16LE. Files exported by older builds can be fixed with
`python formats/pmxio.py "old.pmx"`; the validation log also reports
`文本编码是 UTF-8，MMD 无法载入（需要 UTF-16LE）`.

### PmxEditor reports "アンカーデータの読み込みに失敗しました。" (the model still shows up after you click OK)

**This is not an MMD error — it comes from PmxEditor**, and it has nothing to do with the PMX file itself.

PmxEditor has an "anchor" (アンカー) feature for assigning bone-to-vertex weights in bulk over a spatial region.
Its data **cannot be stored inside a PMX**; it is saved separately as a `*.psk` file (PmxEditor calls it a
"PMX skeleton"). When opening a model, PmxEditor looks for the `.psk` **with the same base name as the model**
and loads it automatically — see its menu `[ファイル] → [アンカーデータの自動読み込み／保存]`. From its readme:

> `[アンカーデータの自動読み込み／保存]` - モデルファイル名と同名のアンカーデータファイル(\*.psk)がある場合自動読み込み

The catch: **`.psk` is also the extension of Unreal ActorX meshes**, which is exactly what this tool reads.
So the most natural naming — converting `R2T1FeiBiMd10011.psk` into `R2T1FeiBiMd10011.pmx` — makes PmxEditor
try to parse that Unreal mesh as its anchor data, which of course fails and raises this message.

**Impact: none.** After clicking OK, PmxEditor simply skips the anchor data and the model loads normally.
To stop the popup entirely:

1. Move the output PMX to another folder, or rename it (anything but `xxx.pmx` next to `xxx.psk`); or
2. Turn off `[ファイル] → [アンカーデータの自動読み込み／保存]` in PmxEditor.

When a same-named `.psk` / `.pskx` sits next to the output PMX, this tool says so in the log.

### About Toon

Every PMX this tool writes, in every direction, **does not use Toon**: materials are written as
`toon_flag=0` + `toon=-1`, which PMXEditor / MMD show as "なし" (none).

⚠️ One easy-to-get-wrong detail worth recording: the width of a PMX material's toon field depends on the
"shared toon flag" byte, and the two directions are easy to swap:

| flag | Meaning | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | Shared / built-in toon | **1 byte index** referring to `toon01.bmp` … `toon10.bmp` in MMD's `Data/` folder — **index 0 *is* `toon01.bmp`** |
| `0` | A texture from this model's texture table | Texture-index width, where **`-1` = none** |

"Index 0 = `toon00.bmp` = no toon" is a widespread misconception — **MMD's `Data/` folder contains no
`toon00.bmp` at all** (only `toon01` … `toon10`), and mmd_tools hard-codes `toon%02d.bmp % (shared + 1)`.
So writing `flag=1, toon=0` actually forces a `toon01.bmp` onto every material. Versions of this tool
before 2026-09-24 did exactly that; it is now fixed to `flag=0, toon=-1`.

### Drag & drop

- Drag & drop relies on the native Windows `WM_DROPFILES` and is **only available on Windows**; on other systems use the "Browse" button to pick a file.
- If the log says "system drag-drop interface not enabled", the current environment does not support native drag & drop; just use the button instead.

### Packaging

1. **You must use `pyinstaller main.spec`** (or the equivalent command with `--paths`), otherwise the engine modules in the sub-directories are left out and runtime throws `No module named 'fbx2pmx'`.
1. **After editing source you must rebuild**; double-clicking the old .exe will not pick up changes.
2. The Python used for packaging must include tkinter (the official Windows installer includes it by default).

The VRM meta carries license information. This tool writes the most conservative default: "Attribution required, redistribution prohibited, modification prohibited".

**Confirm you have the right to use the model before converting** — the tool will not perform a copyright check for you.
